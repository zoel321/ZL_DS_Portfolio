      <description>General experiences from pharmacy that can translate to data science:
1. Accuracy/Meticulousness I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m a naturally detail-oriented person, but being meticulous is required in pharmacy to ensure safe patient care. Some tasks that are done routinely that require accuracy are:
 checking the prescription label &amp;ndash; making sure it&amp;rsquo;s for the right patient, safe with other medications and medical conditions, correct dose and route of administration distinguishing between look-alike, sound-alike drugs (Cerebyx vs Celebrex, lamivudine vs lamotrigine, etc) when both transcribing and dispensing compounding medications &amp;ndash; making sure you are using the appropriate diluent and concentration of drugs, with accurate labeling and storage  Accurately assessing data and interpreting the results is important.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about myself during the bootcamp:
1. I cannot be a perfectionist. I quickly learned you can&amp;rsquo;t predict what you kind of problems you will run into, especially as a beginner.
When I first started the bootcamp, I wanted to have a clear idea of how long things would take and be able to plan my schedule/project approach accordingly.
However, I soon learned that data science is an iterative process, and unpredictable.</description>
